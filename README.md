# Tree
This code snippet defines Red Black Tree and a Binary Search Tree. Then it compares the insertion and search complexities between these two data structures. You can find more documentation in the <b><i>Tree.pdf</b></i> but it's written in italian since it was a university project.
I hope this code snippet helps developers around the world.
